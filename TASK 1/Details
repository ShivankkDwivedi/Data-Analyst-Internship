TASK 1
Hello Everyone ! âœ…
Our First project task for the week was to prepare Yoshops Survey and Order excel charts like Pie Chart and Bar Chart using POWER BI. 
The dataset was given by Yoshops.

* Firstly I imported and Cleaned the data - removed empty spaces, Renamed columns, Replace many values as it contains numerous amount of unnecessary values, changed the data type and few more things.
* Further we visualize the data using charts like Bar chart and pie chart, to make it more authentic and impressive, i used the button feature which help us to navigate through different sheets, Image and link of official Yoshops.com website.
* Lastly, i acquire knowledge of filtering the data, when we are in the visualization process. Example- Top N filter, sum, count. less than greater than values and more.
